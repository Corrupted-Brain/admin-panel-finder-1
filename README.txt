Admin Panel Finder
==================

version: 0.1
author: Randeep Singh

Use this script to find the link for the admin panel of a website.
There is a 'default.txt' file included in this ripo that you can use.
Alternatively, you can create/download your own lists.

If you do create a list yourself, just know that you can use '%EXT%' as a wildcard. Check out the 'default.txt' file to know more about the usage of this. 

In place of a file located on your system, you can give the (http) link of a file on the internet. It will first be downloaded and then used.

USAGE: finder.rb <target> <dictionary.file>
